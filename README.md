the dataset. This website shows the actual most common causes since the 1960s.

#### Getting and Cleaning Data

https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq

The code is developed using R.

The libraries have been used:
* tm
* dplyr
* stringr
* tidyr
* factoextra
* ggplot2
* wordcloud

Performed the following steps to clean data:
* Remove Punctuation
* Convert To Lower Case
* Remove English Stopwords
* Strip Whitespace
* Remove removing generic terms related to airline industry

Converted data into document-terms matrix.

Remove sparse terms from document-terms matrix at 95% threshold.

#### Clustering
Used K-Means Cluster with N = 10 (total number of clustersâ€“ 10).

#### Frequency Charts
The word cloud chart shows the most frequent words in corpus.

The second chart shows the top 20 most frequent terms.
